# MyFirstProjects

Here will be my work done during the training and maybe something else

[File InOut.py]
Write a program that reads from a file a line corresponding to the text compressed using repetition coding and performs the reverse operation, obtaining the original text.
Write the received text to a file and attach it as an answer to this task.

[File InOut_v2.py]
Write a program that reads text from a file (there may be more than one line in the file) and outputs the most frequent word in this text and, separated by a space, how many times it occurred. If there are several such words, output the first one lexicographically (you can use the < operator for strings).
