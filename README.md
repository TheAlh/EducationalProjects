# MyFirstProjects

Here will be my work done during the training and maybe something else

[File InOut.py]
Write a program that reads from a file a line corresponding to the text compressed using repetition coding and performs the reverse operation, obtaining the original text.
Write the received text to a file and attach it as an answer to this task.

[File InOut_v2.py]
Write a program that reads text from a file (there may be more than one line in the file) and outputs the most frequent word in this text and, separated by a space, how many times it occurred. If there are several such words, output the first one lexicographically (you can use the < operator for strings).

[File InOut_v3.py]
There is a file with data on the progress of applicants. It is a set of lines, where each line contains the following information:
Last name; Grade_in_math; Grade_in_physics; Grade_in_language

Fields within a row are separated by semicolons, scores are integers.
Write a program which reads a source file with a similar structure and for each applicant writes his average mark in three subjects on a separate line corresponding to this applicant to the file with the answer.
Also calculate the average scores in math, physics and language for all applicants and add the resulting values, separated by a space,
the last line in the file with the answer.
